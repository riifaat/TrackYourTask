we understand the general concept of the MVC, understanding how it is implemented in different frameworks can be another 
task as some frameworks(Django inclusive) like to implement this same functionality in another way.Even with Django following the MVC pattern, 
it prefers to use itâ€™s own logic in the implementation, the framework considers handling the Controller part of the MVC itself 
and letting most of the good stuff happen in the Model-Template-View,this is why Django is mostly reffered to as the MTV framework.
